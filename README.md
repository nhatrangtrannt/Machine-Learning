This notebook is where I practice projects related to ML with the topics as below:

1. **Loan Eligibility Prediction**
    - Understand factors affecting the loan approval
    - Read csv file
      Visualize data and relationship between features (numerical vs categorical)
    - Boxplot, countplot, distribution plot, stacked bar plot, and heatmap
    - Data cleaning (encode categorical features and fill null values by mode and median)
    - Using sklearn library
    - Fit the following ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, KNeighbors       Classifier, and Naive Bayes)
